NoteQut
=======

A simple application for taking down notes.
This application is written using QtRuby

Development Setup (one time)

```
sudo apt-get install qt-creator cmake
gem install qtbindings # If you are using RVM
 OR
sudo gem install qtbindings # If you are NOT using RVM - make sure you're on Ruby 1.9.3!
```
The steps should be similar for other Linux distributions and OS X.
